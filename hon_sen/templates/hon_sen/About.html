    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <h4>Our objective is to have a database to every newborn that started to get vaccinated. As We </h4>
    <h4>observed, mothers who carry their babies/children waiting in queue in health centers waiting to </h4>
    <h4>have a shot holding a piece of booklet as their reference on what is the next vaccine to be </h4>
    <h4>administered. As we talked to some mothers some of them forgot on when did their </h4>
    <h4>babies got vaccinated and what type of vaccine was given, they rely too much to the baby book </h4>
    <h4>they are holding. What if an unforeseen event happened ? What if the booklet got damaged or lost?</h4>
    <h4>How are they going backtrack the shots? and so, I came up with the idea that it is best that </h4>
    <h4>there should be an e-baby booklet as a guide not only to parents but also to healthcare </h4>
    <h4>professionals so that they may have a reference on what vaccine is next to be administered </h4>
    <h4>even if they (parents) donâ€™t have the booklet on their hands because the information is readily </h4>
    <h4>available online.</h4>
